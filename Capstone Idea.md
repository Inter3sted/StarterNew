# Definition Statement

I want to build an application that utilizes third-party APIs to create a movie recommendation website. ##

# Definition of Audience

The application would be used by movie enthusiasts or anyone who is interested in discovering new movies based on their interests.

# Outline of content

The overall goal is to create a single-page application (SPA), so the site will have a minimum amount of pages to make use of efficient routing.
There will be images to have an idea of what the movie looks like, i.e. Posters and screenshots.
For the color pallet, it will incorporate shades of black, white and grey. 
The font(s) used will more than likely be sans-serif for an easy to read aesthetic. A font such as Roboto, Open Sans, Helvetic and others might be good options.
